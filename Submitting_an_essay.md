## Thank you for thinking about writing for 52 Things!

This page explains how to make a submission.

- The deadline for submissions is 31 October 2017.
- Read the [author instructions](https://www.agilelibre.com/authors).
- Look at some existing chapters to see the style and follow it as closely as you can.
- Chapters should be about 600 words. A figure or two is OK, and code is more than welcome.
- [Fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and add your chapter, preferably in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). 
- If you prefer, [email it to me](mailto:matt@agilescientific.com).
- If you know about some openly licensed (preferably CC-BY) content that would work, please submit that, or just [let me know](mailto:matt@agilescientific.com).
- Add your bio to `bios`, your B&W hi-res headshot to `headshots`, and any figures to `figures` like `figures/yourname_fig1.png`.
- Mark code in your chapter by indenting with 4 spaces.
- Add a row to the table in [README.md](README.md).
- [Make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) back to this repo.

## A word about figures

- Usually there's only room for 1 or 2 figures.
- The book is black and white, please consider this when making figures.
- Figures are reproduced full-width on the page, so aim for 'landscape' orientation. Put smaller or squarer figures side-by side (see below).
- Please provide an SVG or PDF if you can.
- If you provide a raster, PNG is better than JPG
- If you provide a raster, please make it very large: at least 4000 pixels across.
- If you provide a raster, please provide the 'raw' image with no annotation as well as a 'complete' figure with the annotation. I usually end up redrawing figures with the book's fonts etc, and this is easier with a blank slate.
