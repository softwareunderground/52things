## Wish list

If you have a topic you wish someone would write about, please add it here:

- Three ways to get started in geocomputing.
- Drop everything and learn X (Julia? Clojure? vim?).
- Only a quantum computer can do geology.
- Geocomputing at enterprise scale.
- Open sourcing a corporate software project.
- Data standards, lol.
- Geocomputing in the years 2010, 2020, 2030, and 2040.
- Who are/were the pioneers of digital science?
- (How) can machines learn physical (or conceptual?) models?
- Teaching geoscientists to code: Everything Drew Steen said is wrong
- Thank you for the state-of-the-art processing, I will now proceed to interpret it incorrectly.
- Units -sigh- let's start using pint (like metpy), astropy, or _something_.
- How tech ubiquity is changing geoscientific observation.
- 5 math concepts for digital geoscientists: probability, linear algebra, machine learning, graph theory, set theory
- 5 libraries for geophysicists: obspy, madagascar, simpeg, vispy, etc.
- 5 libraries for geologists: pynoddy, qgis, pygmt, pandas/welly/striplog, etc.
- Is the subsurface a Graph? (ask the author of noddy/pynoddy)
- 5 libraries for geobiologists: dplyr, magrittr (maybe), tidyr, vegan, ggplot2
- Innovative geo-solutions: Your organization fears change, so now what?
